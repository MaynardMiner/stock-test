ABSTRACT 1

The Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)
The cash conversion cycle is a key indicator of the adequacy of a company's working capital position. 
Working capital is the difference between a company's current assets, such as cash and current liabilities, 
such as payables owed to suppliers for raw materials. Current assets and liabilities are short-term in nature, 
meaning they're usually on the books for less than one year.

The cash conversion cycle is an indicator of a company's ability to efficiently manage two 
of its most important assets–accounts receivable and inventory. 
Accounts receivable is the total money owed to a company by its 
customers for booked sales.

Components of the The Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)
Days sales outstanding is the average number of days it takes a company to collect payment from their customers
after a sale is made. The cash conversion cycle uses days sales outstanding to help determine whether the company 
is efficient at collecting from its clients.

The cash conversion cycle calculation also calculates how long it takes a company to pay its bills. Days payables 
outstanding represents the average number of days it takes a company to pay its suppliers and vendors.


The third component of the CCC includes how long inventory sits idle. Days inventory outstanding is the 
average number of days that inventory has been in stock before selling it.

Calculated in days, the CCC reflects the time required to collect on sales and the time it takes to 
turn over inventory. The cash conversion cycle calculation helps to determine how well a company is 
collecting and paying its short-term cash transactions. If a company is slow to collect on its receivables, 
for example, a cash shortfall could result and the company could have difficulty paying its bills and payables.

The shorter the cycle, the better. Cash is king, and smart managers know that fast-moving working capital 
is more profitable than unproductive working capital that is tied up in assets.

Formula and Calculation of the Cash Conversion Cycle
​	  
CCC=DIO+DSO−DPO

where:
DIO=Days inventory outstanding
DSO=Days sales outstanding
DPO=Days payables outstanding

There is no single optimal metric for the CCC, which is also referred to as a company's operating cycle. 
As a rule, a company's CCC will be influenced heavily by the type of product or service it provides and 
industry characteristics.

Investors looking for investment quality in this area of a company's balance sheet must track the CCC 
over an extended period of time (for example, five to 10 years) and compare its performance to that of 
competitors. Consistency and decreases in the operating cycle are positive signals. Conversely, erratic 
collection times and an increase in on-hand inventory are typically negative investment-quality indicators.
